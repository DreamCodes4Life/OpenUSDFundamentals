# To load and work with the data, we'll be using a library called Pandas, 
# which is a highly performant tool for loading and manipulating data. 
# We'll read the CSV files into a format called a DataFrame.
# Pandas has a read_csv method that expects a csv file, and returns a DataFrame:
train_df = pd.read_csv("data/asl_data/sign_mnist_train.csv")
valid_df = pd.read_csv("data/asl_data/sign_mnist_valid.csv")

# We can use the head method to print the first few rows of the DataFrame.
train_df.head()

# Extracting the Labels
y_train = train_df.pop('label')
y_valid = valid_df.pop('label')
y_train

# Extracting the Images
x_train = train_df.values
x_valid = valid_df.values
x_train

# Summarizing the Training and Validation Data
x_train.shape
y_train.shape
x_valid.shape
y_valid.shape
